MODULE M4 — INFECTION PREVENTION & STANDARD PRECAUTIONS
5-Minute Lesson Script

INTRODUCTION (20–30 seconds)
“Welcome to Module M4: Infection Prevention.
This module is all about habits — small actions that stop germs from spreading.”

SECTION 1 — HAND HYGIENE (45 seconds)
“Hand hygiene is the most effective infection control measure in healthcare.
We use alcohol hand rub for most situations, but soap and water is required when hands are visibly soiled or after caring for a patient with C. diff.”

SECTION 2 — STANDARD & TRANSMISSION-BASED PRECAUTIONS (60 seconds)
“Standard Precautions apply to every patient.
They include hand hygiene, PPE, safe injection practices, respiratory etiquette, and proper handling of equipment.
Transmission-based precautions include:
* Contact Precautions: gown + gloves
* Droplet Precautions: surgical mask
* Airborne Precautions: N95 respirator
Always follow posted signage and instructions.”

SECTION 3 — ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANING (45 seconds)
“High-touch surfaces — exam tables, blood pressure cuffs, keyboards — must be disinfected between patients.
Pay attention to contact time: the surface must stay wet long enough for the disinfectant to work.
If the label says 2 minutes, 3 minutes, or 5 minutes — follow it.”

SECTION 4 — SCENARIO CHECKPOINT (40 seconds)
“Scenario:
You finish caring for a child with a respiratory infection. Before you leave, you remove your gloves and walk into the hallway still wearing them.
Pause…
What went wrong?
Gloves must be removed before leaving the patient-care area.
Wearing gloves in hallways spreads contamination to everything you touch.”

CLOSING SUMMARY (30 seconds)
“To summarize:
Hand hygiene saves lives.
Use PPE based on the type of precautions.
Clean and disinfect surfaces properly.
Protect yourself, your coworkers, and your patients with consistent daily habits.
When you’re ready, complete the Module M4 quiz.”
