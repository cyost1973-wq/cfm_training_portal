MODULE M8 — HIPAA SECURITY BASICS
5-Minute Lesson Script

INTRODUCTION (20–30 seconds)
“Welcome to Module M8: HIPAA Security.
Where the Privacy Rule protects information in conversations and on paper, the Security Rule protects electronic patient information — known as ePHI.”

SECTION 1 — PASSWORDS & ACCESS CONTROL (45 seconds)
“Strong, unique passwords are your primary defense.
Never share them.
Never write them on sticky notes or shared clipboards.
And never leave a workstation unlocked when you step away — even for a moment.”

SECTION 2 — SECURE COMMUNICATION (60 seconds)
“PHI may only be transmitted over approved, secure systems.
That means:
* No texting PHI
* No emailing PHI from personal accounts
* No sharing screenshots
* No storing PHI on unencrypted devices
If you’re unsure whether a system is secure — stop and ask.”

SECTION 3 — PHISHING, MALWARE, & CYBERTHREATS (45 seconds)
“Many security breaches occur because an employee clicked a malicious link.
Phishing emails often look urgent or official.
Watch for:
* Requests for usernames or passwords
* Attachments you weren't expecting
* Odd spelling or grammar
* Unknown senders
When in doubt, don’t open it.”

SECTION 4 — SCENARIO CHECKPOINT (40 seconds)
“Scenario:
You receive an email claiming to be from IT asking you to ‘verify your username and password.’
Pause…
What should you do?
Do not click anything.
Report the email immediately to leadership.
IT will never ask for your password.”

CLOSING SUMMARY (30 seconds)
“To recap:
Lock your workstation.
Use secure systems only.
Protect your passwords.
Beware of phishing attempts.
Report lost devices and suspicious emails immediately.
When you’re ready, take the Module M8 quiz.”
