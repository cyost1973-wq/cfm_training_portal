MODULE M6 — EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS
5-Minute Lesson Script (Hybrid Style)

INTRODUCTION (20–30 seconds)
“Welcome to Module M6: Emergency Preparedness.
Emergencies can happen anywhere — including healthcare settings — and how we respond determines the safety of our patients, our coworkers, and ourselves.
This lesson will prepare you to respond calmly, confidently, and correctly.”

SECTION 1 — FIRE RESPONSE: RACE & PASS (60 seconds)
“At CFM, we follow two well-established fire response tools: RACE and PASS.
RACE stands for:
* Rescue anyone in immediate danger.
* Alarm by pulling the fire alarm and calling for help.
* Contain the fire by closing doors behind you.
* Evacuate to a safe location.
PASS is how you operate a fire extinguisher:
* Pull the pin
* Aim at the base of the fire
* Squeeze the handle
* Sweep side to side
Only use a fire extinguisher if the fire is small, you’re trained, and you have a clear exit behind you.”

SECTION 2 — SEVERE WEATHER & SHELTERING (45 seconds)
“In North Carolina, severe weather such as tornadoes and strong storms can occur quickly.
If a tornado warning is issued, staff and patients must move to interior rooms or hallways, away from windows and exterior walls.
Know your shelter location now — not during an emergency.”

SECTION 3 — MEDICAL EMERGENCIES (45 seconds)
“When a medical emergency occurs inside the clinic, your role depends on your training.
But the first step is always the same:
Call 911 immediately.
Then notify the provider on duty and follow instructions.
Don’t assume someone else has called — verify it.”

SECTION 4 — AGGRESSIVE OR VIOLENT BEHAVIOR (45 seconds)
“Patients or visitors may become frustrated, angry, or unpredictable.
Your safety comes first.
Use these principles:
* Maintain personal space
* Keep a calm tone
* Offer choices when possible
* Know your exit path
* Get help early — don’t wait for escalation
If a weapon is present or a threat is credible, call 911 immediately.”

SECTION 5 — SCENARIO CHECKPOINT (40 seconds)
“Scenario:
You notice smoke coming from a supply closet. The fire is small and contained to a trash can.
No one is in danger.
Pause…
What should you do?
If you are trained and the fire is manageable, you may use a fire extinguisher using PASS.
If not, follow RACE: Rescue if needed, sound the alarm, close the door, and evacuate.”

CLOSING SUMMARY (30 seconds)
“To recap:
Use RACE and PASS during fire emergencies.
Shelter in designated interior areas during severe weather.
Call 911 for medical or behavioral emergencies.
Stay calm, communicate clearly, and protect yourself first.
When you’re ready, complete the Module M6 quiz.”
