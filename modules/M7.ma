MODULE M7 — HIPAA PRIVACY BASICS
5-Minute Lesson Script

INTRODUCTION (20–30 seconds)
“Welcome to Module M7: HIPAA Privacy.
Privacy is a core part of patient trust.
Every patient deserves confidentiality — in their chart, in conversation, and in every part of their care experience.”

SECTION 1 — WHAT IS PHI? (45 seconds)
“PHI stands for Protected Health Information, which includes any identifiable health data:
names, addresses, birthdates, diagnoses, test results, photos, billing information — anything that can identify a patient.”

SECTION 2 — PRIVACY PRINCIPLES AT CFM (60 seconds)
“Our approach to HIPAA is simple:
1. Minimum Necessary Access
You view only what you need for your role.
2. Need-to-Know Use
You share PHI only with team members involved in the patient’s care.
3. Private Conversations Only
No PHI in hallways, lobbies, or break rooms.
4. Protected Documentation
PHI must never be left on counters, unlocked screens, or public printers.”

SECTION 3 — SOCIAL MEDIA & PERSONAL DEVICES (45 seconds)
“PHI must never appear on social media — not even indirectly.
No photos of patients.
No posts about cases, symptoms, or dramatic events.
Personal phones cannot be used to store, send, or photograph any patient information.
Ever.”

SECTION 4 — SCENARIO CHECKPOINT (40 seconds)
“Scenario:
A coworker begins discussing a patient’s lab results in the hallway where others can hear.
Pause…
What is the correct response?
Kindly interrupt and move the conversation to a private area.
Patient privacy cannot depend on convenience.”

CLOSING SUMMARY (30 seconds)
“To summarize:
Protect PHI everywhere and at all times.
Use minimum necessary access.
Keep conversations private.
Never use personal devices for patient information.
When you’re ready, complete the Module M7 quiz.”
