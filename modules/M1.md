MODULE M1 — WELCOME & CFM CULTURE
5-Minute Lesson Script (Hybrid Style)
Voice-Ready for AI Trainer

INTRODUCTION (30 seconds)
“Welcome to Coastline Family Medicine and Coastline Urgent Care. We’re glad you’re here.
During this short lesson, I’ll walk you through the core culture of CFM — the values, expectations, and behaviors that guide how we treat our patients and how we treat each other.
Think of this as your foundation. The rest of your training will make much more sense once you understand what we stand for and how we work together.”

SECTION 1 – OUR CULTURAL PILLARS (60 seconds)
“CFM is built on three cultural pillars:
* Professionalism, Safety, and Accountability.
* Professionalism means that no matter how busy the day becomes, we communicate respectfully, we protect confidentiality, and we take pride in the service we provide. Our patients feel it the moment they walk in — and so will you.
* Safety is not a buzzword here. It is an expectation. Every employee is responsible for noticing hazards, preventing errors, and speaking up. Safety isn’t a supervisor’s job — it’s everyone’s job.
* Accountability means we own our work. If something isn’t right, we don’t ignore it. We fix it, or we find someone who can. This is how we build trust with one another and deliver consistent care.”

SECTION 2 – HOW WE COMMUNICATE (60 seconds)
“At CFM, communication matters. Small misunderstandings can lead to mistakes, so we use a few key habits:
* Closed-loop communication — when someone gives you information, you repeat it back in your own words. This eliminates confusion and prevents errors.
* Asking questions early — we don’t wait until something goes wrong to get clarification. If you’re unsure about a task, policy, or expectation, ask. You will never be criticized for wanting to do things the right way.
* Respectful dialogue — we communicate directly, calmly, and without gossip. Our patients and coworkers depend on us to be clear and professional.”

SECTION 3 – HOW WE SHOW UP EVERY DAY (60–75 seconds)
“CFM culture is something we practice through small, consistent actions.
You show it by:
* Being prepared and ready when your shift starts.
* Keeping your workspace clean and organized.
* Helping your coworkers when they are overloaded.
* Protecting patient privacy at all times.
* Following safety rules even when no one is watching.
You’ll also see that we shut down unproductive behaviors quickly.
Things like gossip, disrespect, or complaining about patients or coworkers do not fit here. We handle concerns professionally — either directly with the person involved or through leadership if needed. Always pass negatives up to leadership and pass positives all around!”

SECTION 4 – WHAT PATIENTS EXPECT FROM US (45 seconds)
“Our patients may be sick, worried, or frustrated when they come to us.
They trust us to be calm, competent, and kind.
That means:
* We greet everyone warmly.
* We listen without interrupting.
* We explain what we’re doing and why.
* We maintain privacy and dignity.
* We treat every patient with respect — even on tough days.
You are now part of the experience that shapes how patients view CFM.”

SECTION 5 – SCENARIO CHECKPOINT (45 seconds)
“Here’s a quick scenario to think about:
A patient raises their voice because the wait time is longer than expected.
They’re not yelling at you personally — they’re frustrated.
Ask yourself:
* How do I respond professionally?
* How can I de-escalate the situation?
* Who do I involve if the behavior continues?
The right answer is:
Stay calm, acknowledge their frustration, provide clear information, and involve a supervisor if needed.
This one interaction reflects your professionalism and our culture.”

SECTION 6 – DAILY CULTURE HABITS (30 seconds)
“To keep our culture strong, we practice a few simple daily habits:
* Colossians 3:23 - We do our work as unto the Lord.
* We are crusaders doing work that matters.
* We believe character matters. All the time.
* We balance family and working hard.
* Speak clearly and respectfully.
* Step in to help without being asked.
* Protect patient privacy everywhere — hallways, break rooms, and social media.
* Report safety concerns immediately.
* Be honest, courteous, and kind toward team members.
* No Gossip - We pass negatives up and positives all around.
* We are team members, not employees.
* Make a contious choice to be happy every day.
These habits create a workplace where people enjoy working and patients feel cared for.”

CLOSING SUMMARY (30 seconds)
“To summarize:
* CFM culture is built on character, professionalism, safety, and accountability.
* We communicate clearly.
* We work respectfully.
* We protect our patients, our coworkers, and ourselves.
* You are now part of that culture, and your actions will help shape it every day.
