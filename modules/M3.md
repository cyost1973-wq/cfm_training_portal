MODULE M3 — BLOODBORNE PATHOGENS & SHARPS SAFETY
5-Minute Lesson Script

INTRODUCTION (20–30 seconds)
“Welcome to Module M3: Bloodborne Pathogens and Sharps Safety.
This module protects you from some of the most serious risks in healthcare — HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and other infectious exposures.”

SECTION 1 — WHAT ARE BLOODBORNE PATHOGENS? (45 seconds)
“Bloodborne pathogens are microorganisms in blood or certain body fluids that can cause disease.
Because we cannot always tell who is infectious, we use Standard Precautions for every patient, every time.”

SECTION 2 — SHARPS SAFETY (60 seconds)
“Sharps injuries are the most common exposure incident in healthcare.
To prevent them:
* Never recap needles.
* Never pass sharps hand-to-hand. Use a tray instead.
* Dispose of sharps immediately after use — never set them down.
* Do not use overfilled sharps containers.
* Keep your eyes on your hands when giving injections or drawing blood.
One moment of distraction can cause a career-changing injury.”

SECTION 3 — EXPOSURE RESPONSE (45 seconds)
“If an exposure occurs, time matters.
For needle sticks or cuts:
1. Wash the area with soap and water.
2. Notify a supervisor immediately.
3. Go directly for medical evaluation.
For splashes to the eyes:
* Rinse with water for 15 minutes and report immediately.
Post-exposure medication is most effective when started quickly — preferably within minutes to hours.”

SECTION 4 — SCENARIO CHECKPOINT (40 seconds)
“Here’s a scenario:
You notice a coworker recapping a needle after giving an injection.
Pause…
What should you do?
The correct action is to speak up immediately and remind them of the no-recap rule.
Sharps injuries are preventable — and speaking up may save someone’s health.”

CLOSING SUMMARY (30 seconds)
“To recap:
Prevent sharps injuries by staying alert, disposing of sharps immediately, and never recapping needles.
Treat every patient as potentially infectious.
Report exposures instantly — delay increases risk.
When you're ready, continue to the Module M3 quiz.”
