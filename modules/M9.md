MODULE M9 — INCIDENT & NEAR-MISS REPORTING
5-Minute Lesson Script

INTRODUCTION (20–30 seconds)
“Welcome to Module M9: Incident and Near-Miss Reporting.
Reporting is how we improve systems, prevent injuries, and protect patients and staff.
Your willingness to report issues strengthens our entire clinic.”

SECTION 1 — WHAT IS AN INCIDENT? (45 seconds)
“An incident is any event that causes or could have caused harm:
* A sharps injury
* A fall
* A chemical spill
* An equipment malfunction
* A privacy breach
* A patient safety concern”

SECTION 2 — NEAR MISSES (45–60 seconds)
“A near miss is an event that almost caused harm but didn’t — often by luck.
Near misses are just as important as incidents because they reveal weaknesses before someone gets hurt.
Examples include:
* A needle dropped on the floor
* A mislabeled medication caught before administration
* A slippery floor noticed before someone falls”

SECTION 3 — REPORTING PROCESS (45 seconds)
“At CFM, reporting is simple:
1. Ensure immediate safety.
2. Notify your supervisor.
3. Document what happened, quickly and accurately.
You will never be punished for reporting a concern in good faith.
Retaliation is strictly prohibited.”

SECTION 4 — SCENARIO CHECKPOINT (40 seconds)
“Scenario:
You slip on a wet spot in the hallway but manage to catch yourself before falling.
Pause…
Should you report it?
Yes.
This is a near miss — and reporting it may prevent the next person from being injured.”

CLOSING SUMMARY (30 seconds)
“To summarize:
Incidents and near misses must be reported promptly.
Reporting helps us correct issues before harm occurs.
Your voice strengthens our safety culture and protects everyone who walks through our doors.”
