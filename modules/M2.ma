MODULE M2 — GENERAL SAFETY RULES
5-Minute Lesson Script (Hybrid Voice)

INTRODUCTION (20–30 seconds)
“Welcome to Module M2: General Safety Rules.
These are the rules that keep you, your coworkers, and our patients safe every hour of every shift.
At CFM, safety isn’t a list on a wall — it’s a set of habits.
As you listen, imagine how these rules fit into your daily flow.”

SECTION 1 — WHY SAFETY RULES MATTER (45 seconds)
“Healthcare settings have unique risks: sharps, chemicals, spills, injured patients, and unexpected emergencies.
Safety rules exist because real people have been harmed when these rules were ignored.
Our approach is simple:
If something can hurt someone, we control it, remove it, or report it.
You are empowered to stop unsafe work, prevent injuries, and speak up immediately.”

SECTION 2 — PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (45 seconds)
“PPE is your first line of defense. Gloves, masks, eye protection, and gowns all protect you from exposure.
At CFM:
* PPE must be worn whenever there’s a risk of contact with blood or body fluids.
* PPE must be removed before leaving the patient-care area.
* Gloves must never replace hand hygiene.
In short: PPE is worn based on the task, not the patient.”

SECTION 3 — SAFE WORK PRACTICES (60 seconds)
“A few daily safety practices make a big difference:
1. Housekeeping
Clear floors, dry surfaces, no stacked boxes, no clutter in hallways.
2. Sharps Safety
Sharps go directly into containers — never on counters, never carried, and never recapped.
3. Electrical Safety
If something sparks, overheats, or makes a smell, unplug it and report it immediately.
4. Safe Lifting
Use your legs, keep items close to your body, avoid twisting, and ask for help with heavy loads.
5. Situational Awareness
You should always know your surroundings — where patients, needles, and equipment are at all times.”

SECTION 4 — CHEMICAL & ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY (45 seconds)
“Chemicals must be used exactly as labeled.
Mixing cleaning chemicals can release toxic fumes — never mix anything unless explicitly allowed.
Every hazardous chemical has an SDS available.
If you don’t know what something is, or how to clean it — stop and ask.
Environmental awareness also includes:
* Keeping exits clear
* Ensuring fire extinguishers and sharps containers are accessible
* Reporting spills and leaks immediately”

SECTION 5 — SCENARIO CHECKPOINT (40 seconds)
“Imagine this scenario:
You walk into a patient room and notice an overfilled sharps container.
It is so full that needles are sticking upward.
What should you do?
Pause and think.
The correct action is:
Do not use the container. Mark the room unsafe for sharps use. Notify a supervisor and replace the container before continuing patient care.
One small action can prevent a life-changing injury.”

CLOSING SUMMARY (30 seconds)
“To summarize:
General safety rules are the backbone of a safe workplace.
Wear PPE appropriately.
Dispose of sharps immediately.
Keep hallways and exam rooms clean.
Handle chemicals carefully.
Report hazards right away — no exceptions.
When you’re ready, proceed to the Module M2 quiz.”
